Private detective Harriet Hesterton had been recruited by her colleague Mahmud Mufti to assist in a case. Some shadowy organization was making counterfeit coins and distributing them to conspiring (or coerced) store owners, who mixed them in with real coins to hide their tracks before giving them as change to customers. Harriet and Mahmud were at what they suspected was one such store.</description></item><item><title>The Magic Checkerboard</title><link>/posts/the-magic-checkerboard/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/the-magic-checkerboard/</guid><description>Two siblings, Janelle and Terrence, are visiting their friends Amy and Sarah. Terrence has just won a game of checkers against Amy for the second time in a row.
&amp;ldquo;Hey Sarah,&amp;rdquo; Amy said. &amp;ldquo;This checkerboard reminds me of the magic trick you showed me yesterday.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Magic trick?&amp;rdquo; asked Janelle.
&amp;ldquo;The one where you cut up the grid,&amp;rdquo; Amy prompted her big sister. &amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s show Terrence and Janelle!&amp;rdquo;

Since extraterrestrials don&amp;rsquo;t have five fingers, doing business in multiples of one, five, and ten Earth dollars doesn&amp;rsquo;t really make sense, and neither does doing business in multiples of one, 17, and 68 Yrxiggian knuggyts. Instead, the interplanetary currency is called a blyp, and it comes in multiples of 1, 2, 4, 8, and so on: the powers of 2.</description></item><item><title>Pirate Gold</title><link>/posts/pirate-gold/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/pirate-gold/</guid><description>The five crew members of a small pirate ship have just completed a raid in another crew&amp;rsquo;s territory, and they now have 100 gold coins to split among themselves.

She found a tilework company, Mort&amp;rsquo;s Tilework, that can cut tile into complex shapes like the one she has in mind:
Mort&amp;rsquo;s Tilework has a seemingly simple pricing scheme for a tile order: $0.25 per square centimeter of area plus $0.10 per centimeter of perimeter. To place her order, Paula needs to send in both a schematic of her shape and her calculations for the area and perimeter of the shape.</description></item><item><title>A Magic Trick</title><link>/posts/a-magic-trick/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/a-magic-trick/</guid><description>Private detective Harriet Hesterton picked up the phone.
&amp;ldquo;Hi Detective Hesterton. This is Gus Spurious,&amp;rdquo; said the voice on the other side.
&amp;ldquo;Good afternoon. Do you have another suspicious proof to examine?&amp;rdquo; she replied, remembering their last conversation.
&amp;ldquo;No,&amp;rdquo; said Gus. &amp;ldquo;I have a magic trick I can&amp;rsquo;t figure out. My friend Alina showed it to me and ever since then I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to understand how it works.&amp;rdquo;

a. Morton is a tour guide for the town, based on the east side of the south island (in the blue building). He advertises to tourists that his walking tour crosses every bridge in the city.

The tiles are 1x2, and the hallway is just wide enough for one of these tiles to fit horizontally.
Paula knows she doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to tile the hallway all the way to the back of the house, since the carpet from the den can stretch across some portion of the hallway; she hasn&amp;rsquo;t decided exactly how long the tiling will be, though.</description></item><item><title>Pennies</title><link>/posts/pennies/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/pennies/</guid><description>Suppose you have 8 pennies, and you arrange 7 of them in a cluster like this:Now suppose you take the eighth penny and place it at the top:

Then, suddenly, one of the swans hears something in a bush at the water&amp;rsquo;s edge, and it takes off and flies away.
Suppose that if $k$ swans have flown away, the probability of another swan subsequently joining them is $1-\frac{1}{k+3}$ (so the more swans fly, the more likely it is that more swans fly also). What is the probability that the entire flock of $n$ swans flies away once the first one takes off?</description></item><item><title>City Council</title><link>/posts/city-council/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Dec 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/city-council/</guid><description>A certain city is entirely inhabited by knights and liars. Knights, consistently chivalrous, always tell the truth. Liars, on the contrary, never tell the truth. One can never tell whether a citizen is a knight or a liar just by their appearance.
The city council, recently elected, is composed of twelve of the city&amp;rsquo;s most eminent inhabitants. One day they come together to a council meeting. They all recognize each other and know which members of the group are knights and which are liars.</description></item><item><title>Cut Corners</title><link>/posts/cut-corners/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Sep 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/cut-corners/</guid><description>Paula is re-doing the floor tiling in the kitchen. The space is shaped like an 8x8 square, except that one corner is missing to make room for the refrigerator and the opposite corner is missing to leave space for the dishwasher.
Paula found a domino-shaped (1x2) tile she&amp;rsquo;d like to use to tile the space:
How many ways are there for her to tile the kitchen with this shape?

But let&amp;rsquo;s take another close look at our Fibonacci number friends.
In particular, let&amp;rsquo;s ask ourselves what happens if we divide each Fibonacci number by the one before it.
You recognize 1.618? (If not, go look back at our definition of the Golden Ratio!) It certainly looks like these Fibonacci ratios are converging on the Golden Ratio.</description></item><item><title>A Triangle of Prime Opportunity - Solution</title><link>/brain-play/a-triangle-of-prime-opportunity-solution/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/brain-play/a-triangle-of-prime-opportunity-solution/</guid><description>→ Print-friendly version Let&amp;rsquo;s call the side lengths $a$, $b$, and $c$, and the altitudes $x$, $y$, and $z$.
(By the way, a fun fact: the altitudes of any triangle intersect in a single point called the orthocenter.)
What next? Well, we have altitudes; maybe that&amp;rsquo;s a clue. So what&amp;rsquo;s special about altitudes?
One thing that altitudes let us do is very easily calculate the area of the triangle. And since we have all three side lengths and all three altitudes, we can calculate the same area in three different ways:</description></item><item><title>An Interplanetary Currency - Solution</title><link>/brain-play/an-interplanetary-currency-solution/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/brain-play/an-interplanetary-currency-solution/</guid><description>Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the 6-blyp case.

If $x=0$, then all of the councilmembers are liars.

The hard thing about this problem is the n. A good strategy here is to start with small numbers and build up and generalize.
So let&amp;rsquo;s look at n=1.
This case is pretty simple: there&amp;rsquo;s only room for one domino on this grid, and there&amp;rsquo;s only one way to place it.
Now let&amp;rsquo;s look at n=2.
This case is also pretty simple: there&amp;rsquo;s room for 2 dominoes side by side, and we could either place them both horizontally or both vertically.</description></item><item><title>Factorials!</title><link>/better-ways-to-count/factorials/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/better-ways-to-count/factorials/</guid><description>→ Print-friendly version Five-year-old Harry is obsessed with rabbits.

We already know that you get the next term in the sequence by adding the two terms before it. But let&amp;rsquo;s explore this sequence a little further.
First, let&amp;rsquo;s talk about divisors.

Specifically, let&amp;rsquo;s investigate a biologically unrealistic rabbit population that is multiplying like&amp;hellip; well, rabbits.
Every month, the following rule is applied: - Each pair of adults produces a new pair of baby rabbits. - Each pair of baby rabbits matures into a pair of adults.
We can abbreviate these rules by using &amp;ldquo;W&amp;rdquo; for a pair of adult rabbits and &amp;ldquo;w&amp;rdquo; for a pair of baby rabbits (&amp;ldquo;w&amp;rdquo; signifying two pairs of rabbit ears, of course).</description></item><item><title>Koch Snowflake Area</title><link>/fractals/koch-snowflake/koch-snowflake-area/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/fractals/koch-snowflake/koch-snowflake-area/</guid><description>→ Print-friendly version The Koch Snowflake has an infinite perimeter, but all its squiggles stay crumpled up in a finite area. So how big is this finite area, exactly?
To answer that, let&amp;rsquo;s look again at The Rule.
When we apply The Rule, the area of the snowflake increases by that little triangle under the zigzag. So we need two pieces of information:
Each time we apply The Rule, how many little triangles do we add?</description></item><item><title>Leapfrog - Solution</title><link>/brain-play/leapfrog-solution/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/brain-play/leapfrog-solution/</guid><description>→ Print-friendly version If you&amp;rsquo;ve played with this problem for a while, you might have noticed that getting to (1, 1) is quite troublesome. Every time the frogs seem to get close, they just miss the mark.
There&amp;rsquo;s a reason for that!
To see why this is so hard, let&amp;rsquo;s take a closer look at what a leap looks like.
To get from one frog&amp;rsquo;s location to another frog&amp;rsquo;s location, you can always take some number of steps to the right and some number of steps up.</description></item><item><title>Light Bulbs - Solution</title><link>/brain-play/light-bulbs-solution/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/brain-play/light-bulbs-solution/</guid><description>→ Print-friendly version Imagine that each light bulb is numbered: Bulb 1, Bulb 2, Bulb 3, etc. When Rachel pulls the chain of every nth bulb, only the bulb numbers divisible by n are affected. To see how the procedure affects an individual bulb, then, we just need to look at its divisors.
Take the case of Bulb 12. The divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12, as we can see when we multiply:</description></item><item><title>Moving Day - Solution</title><link>/brain-play/moving-day-solution/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/brain-play/moving-day-solution/</guid><description>→ Print-friendly version The first thing we notice is that the choices for the basketballs, volleyballs, baseballs, and golf balls are all independent: how Leslie assigns one type of ball to the different trucks doesn&amp;rsquo;t restrict how she might assign a different type of ball to the different trucks.

Here&amp;rsquo;s how it works. We start with an equilateral triangle, which is one where all three sides are the same length:
Now we repeat the following rule on this triangle indefinitely:
The Rule: Whenever you see an equilateral triangle, like the one below on the left, chop it up into four little equilateral triangles, and get rid of the middle upside-down triangle, so you&amp;rsquo;re left with the thing on the right.</description></item><item><title>Some Neat Features</title><link>/better-ways-to-count/pascals-triangle/some-neat-features/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/better-ways-to-count/pascals-triangle/some-neat-features/</guid><description>→ Print-friendly version Pascal&amp;rsquo;s Triangle is riddled with intriguing patterns and embedded sequences.

After the first swan takes off, we&amp;rsquo;re at $k=1$. The probability that a second swan takes off is $1 - \frac{1}{1+3} = 1 - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4}$.
After the second swan takes off, we&amp;rsquo;re at $k=2$.

It&amp;rsquo;s not a googol, which is a 1 with a hundred zeroes after it. It&amp;rsquo;s not a googolplex, which is a 1 with a googol zeroes after it.

That means if there are 2 pebbles left and it&amp;rsquo;s your turn, you should take away 1; and if there are 3 pebbles left, you should take 2. In those cases you can force the troll to take the last pebble.
On the other hand, you don&amp;rsquo;t want to have 4 pebbles left when it&amp;rsquo;s your turn, because after your turn there will be 2 or 3 pebbles left and the troll will be able to make you take the last pebble.</description></item><item><title>Wolf, Goat, Lettuce - Solution</title><link>/brain-play/wolf-goat-lettuce-solution/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/brain-play/wolf-goat-lettuce-solution/</guid><description>→ Print-friendly version Farmer Brown can&amp;rsquo;t take the wolf across first, since then the goat would be left behind with the lettuce, and we know what goats do to lettuce.
