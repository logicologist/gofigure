What if you zoomed in on a picture and it didn't get blurry or pixellated? What if instead you saw little copies of the big picture, and if you zoomed in on those you'd find more little copies, and you could keep on zooming and you'd always find more detail?

Welcome to the wonderful world of fractals.

A fractal is a figure with infinite detail. Every fractal begins with a starting shape, and then some rule is applied to it over and over again forever. The result is a sort of cross between math and art.

A good place to get started is the [Sierpinski Triangle](/fractals/sierpinski/ "Sierpinski"). Another great one is the [Koch Snowflake](/fractals/koch-snowflake/ "Koch Snowflake").
