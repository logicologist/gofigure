Paula is re-doing the floor tiling in the kitchen. The space is shaped like an 8x8 square, except that one corner is missing to make room for the refrigerator and the opposite corner is missing to leave space for the dishwasher.

Paula found a domino-shaped (1x2) tile she'd like to use to tile the space:
