Chef Charles is creating a couple of salt-and-pepper blends to simplify the process of seasoning a dish. He starts with two ordinary salt and pepper shakers, both the same size and both filled the same amount. To make the seasoning blends, Charles measures out one teaspoon of pepper from the pepper shaker and adds it to the salt shaker, stirring to mix in the pepper evenly; he then measures out one teaspoon of this salt-and-pepper mix, adds it back to the pepper shaker, and stirs. After this is done, will there be more salt in the pepper shaker or more pepper in the salt shaker?
