You have been captured by an evil troll. The troll doesn't have much to do besides capture people, so to amuse itself it's made a bargain with you: you are to play a certain game with the troll, and if you win, you go free.

The game starts with a pile of 50 pebbles. Players take turns removing either 1 or 2 pebbles from the pile. The player to take away the last pebble from the pile loses the game.

It's your move. What's your strategy to ensure you win the game?
