A flock of $n$ swans is sitting peacefully on a pond. Then, suddenly, one of the swans hears something in a bush at the water's edge, and it takes off and flies away.

Suppose that if $k$ swans have flown away, the probability of another swan subsequently joining them is $1-\frac{1}{k+3}$ (so the more swans fly, the more likely it is that more swans fly also). What is the probability that the entire flock of $n$ swans flies away once the first one takes off?

The solution can be found [here](/brain-play/swans-solution/). Happy puzzling!
