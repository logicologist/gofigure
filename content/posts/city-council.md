A certain city is entirely inhabited by knights and liars. Knights, consistently chivalrous, always tell the truth. Liars, on the contrary, never tell the truth. One can never tell whether a citizen is a knight or a liar just by their appearance.

The city council, recently elected, is composed of twelve of the city's most eminent inhabitants. One day they come together to a council meeting. They all recognize each other and know which members of the group are knights and which are liars.

The first councilmember states: "None of the people in this room tells the truth."

The second councilmember says: "Not more than 1 person in this room tells the truth."

The third councilmember asserts: "Not more than 2 people in this room tell the truth."

The rest of the councilmembers continue the pattern, ending with the twelfth, who says: "Not more than 11 people in this room tell the truth."

How many knights and how many liars are on the city council?
