Who knew that flowers and pinecones could do math?

Okay, so plants don't calculate square roots (no pun intended). But the way they grow is still governed by mathematics.

To start getting acquainted with nature's math, check out the [Fibonacci sequence](/natures-favorite-math/fibonacci-numbers/ "Fibonacci Numbers") and how it relates to [rabbits](/natures-favorite-math/fibonacci-numbers/fibonacci-rabbits/ "Fibonacci Rabbits") and [rhododendrons](/natures-favorite-math/fibonacci-numbers/fibonacci-in-nature/ "Fibonacci in Nature"). After that, feel free to explore the [Golden Ratio](/natures-favorite-math/the-golden-ratio/ "The Golden Ratio"), a proportion that's important but often misunderstood. The next time you go for a walk, you'll be able to see a new level of beauty in the plants around you!
