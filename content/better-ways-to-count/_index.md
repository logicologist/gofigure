Sometimes 1-2-3 just isn't enough.

What do you do when you're trying to find the number of ways to arrange 6 people in a line? Or when you're counting the number of ways to pick 2 ice cream flavors out of 14? Or when you're figuring out how many ways a pinball might fall to the bottom of the pinball machine?

Maybe 1-2-3 doesn't solve the problem in these cases, but math can still help us find the answers!

The first tool we can add to our toolbox is [factorials](/better-ways-to-count/factorials/ "Factorials!"). From there we can tackle problems of [choosing](/better-ways-to-count/on-choosing/ "On Choosing"), which will help us when we [count paths](/better-ways-to-count/path-counting/ "Path Counting"). These ideas can help us understand a very important and beautiful mathematical structure called [Pascal's Triangle](/better-ways-to-count/pascals-triangle/ "Pascal’s Triangle").

Good luck! Counting is about to become very exciting!
