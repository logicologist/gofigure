Gus was excited. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve been stuck on this for days! How did you solve it?&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;First,&amp;rdquo; Harriet told him, &amp;ldquo;I wrote the two-digit number as $10a + b$, where $a$ and $b$ are variables representing digits between 0 and 9.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Okay,&amp;rdquo; said Gus. &amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s what I did, too.</description></item><item><title>A Phony Proof - Solution</title><link>https://gofiguremath.org/brain-play/a-phony-proof-solution/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gofiguremath.org/brain-play/a-phony-proof-solution/</guid><description>→ Print-friendly version &amp;ldquo;The problem,&amp;rdquo; Detective Harriet Hesterton told Gus, &amp;ldquo;happens when you divide both sides of the equation by $x - y$. You started by saying that $x = y$, but that means $x - y = 0$. When you divide both sides by $x - y$, you&amp;rsquo;re really dividing by zero.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Why is that a problem?&amp;rdquo; Gus asked, not giving up yet.
&amp;ldquo;Say you start with the equation $0 = 0$,&amp;rdquo; Harriet explained.</description></item><item><title>A Recurrence Riddle - Solution</title><link>https://gofiguremath.org/brain-play/a-recurrence-riddle-solution/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gofiguremath.org/brain-play/a-recurrence-riddle-solution/</guid><description>→ Print-friendly version Let&amp;rsquo;s start by computing the first few terms of the sequence:
$$ \begin{align} a_1 &amp;amp;= 1 \\ a_2 &amp;amp;= 1 + 2(2) - 1 = 4 \\ a_3 &amp;amp;= 4 + 2(3) - 1 = 9 \\ a_4 &amp;amp;= 9 + 2(4) - 1 = 16 \\ a_5 &amp;amp;= 16 + 2(5) - 1 = 25 \\ a_6 &amp;amp;= 25 + 2(6) - 1 = 36 \end{align} $$</description></item><item><title>A Triangle of Prime Opportunity - Solution</title><link>https://gofiguremath.org/brain-play/a-triangle-of-prime-opportunity-solution/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gofiguremath.org/brain-play/a-triangle-of-prime-opportunity-solution/</guid><description>→ Print-friendly version Let&amp;rsquo;s call the side lengths $a$, $b$, and $c$, and the altitudes $x$, $y$, and $z$.
(By the way, a fun fact: the altitudes of any triangle intersect in a single point called the orthocenter.)
What next? Well, we have altitudes; maybe that&amp;rsquo;s a clue. So what&amp;rsquo;s special about altitudes?
One thing that altitudes let us do is very easily calculate the area of the triangle. And since we have all three side lengths and all three altitudes, we can calculate the same area in three different ways:</description></item><item><title>An Interplanetary Currency - Solution</title><link>https://gofiguremath.org/brain-play/an-interplanetary-currency-solution/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gofiguremath.org/brain-play/an-interplanetary-currency-solution/</guid><description>Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the 6-blyp case. The first thing we notice is that the ATM will never give Alex an 8-blyp coin for this problem, since 6 &amp;lt; 8. So it&amp;rsquo;s enough for us to solve this problem just with 1, 2, and 4 blyp coins.
After playing around with this for a bit, we might notice that some ways of making 6 blyps involve a 4-blyp coin while others don&amp;rsquo;t.</description></item><item><title>Bridging the Gap - Solution</title><link>https://gofiguremath.org/brain-play/bridging-the-gap-solution/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gofiguremath.org/brain-play/bridging-the-gap-solution/</guid><description>→ Print-friendly version a. After a bit of thinking, the first thing we notice about this problem is that the bridges are the only things that matter: the shape and size of the islands are irrelevant. So we can simplify each terrestrial region down to a single point &amp;ndash; let&amp;rsquo;s call the points A, B, C, and D &amp;ndash; and let each bridge correspond to a line between two points:</description></item><item><title>City Council - Solution</title><link>https://gofiguremath.org/brain-play/city-council-solution/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gofiguremath.org/brain-play/city-council-solution/</guid><description>→ Print-friendly version Let&amp;rsquo;s say that there are $x$ knights on the city council. If we can figure out what the value of $x$ is, we&amp;rsquo;ll be practically done. We can start our exploration with a couple of extreme cases:
If $x=0$, then all of the councilmembers are liars. But then the first councilmember&amp;rsquo;s statement is true, and since liars never tell the truth, that means the first person is a knight.</description></item><item><title>Counterfeit Detective - Solution</title><link>https://gofiguremath.org/brain-play/counterfeit-detective-solution/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gofiguremath.org/brain-play/counterfeit-detective-solution/</guid><description>→ Print-friendly version Harriet pulled out 1 coin from the first bag, 2 coins from the second bag, 3 coins from the third bag, and so on, up through 10 coins from the tenth bag.
&amp;ldquo;If all of these were real,&amp;rdquo; she thought to herself, &amp;ldquo;they would weigh $(1 + 2 + \ldots + 10) \cdot 5 \textrm{ grams} = 275 \textrm{ grams}$. But some of them are fake, so the total will be less than that &amp;ndash; and the difference will tell me which bag holds the fakes.</description></item><item><title>Cut Corners - Solution</title><link>https://gofiguremath.org/brain-play/cut-corners-solution/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gofiguremath.org/brain-play/cut-corners-solution/</guid><description>→ Print-friendly version Let&amp;rsquo;s take a closer look at that grid.
Maybe you&amp;rsquo;ve played with this for a while without coming up with a valid domino tiling. It&amp;rsquo;s definitely not as easy as it looks!
To see why, let&amp;rsquo;s color this grid like a checkerboard:
(Give this problem another try before reading more. I&amp;rsquo;ll wait.)
&amp;hellip;
&amp;hellip;
&amp;hellip;
&amp;hellip;
&amp;hellip;
Okay. The key to finishing here is to notice that every time we place a domino on this checkerboard, we cover up one white square and one green square.</description></item><item><title>Duo Dominoes - Solution</title><link>https://gofiguremath.org/brain-play/duo-dominoes-solution/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gofiguremath.org/brain-play/duo-dominoes-solution/</guid><description>→ Print-friendly version Let&amp;rsquo;s take another look at that 2xn region.
The hard thing about this problem is the n. A good strategy here is to start with small numbers and build up and generalize.
So let&amp;rsquo;s look at n=1.
This case is pretty simple: there&amp;rsquo;s only room for one domino on this grid, and there&amp;rsquo;s only one way to place it.
Now let&amp;rsquo;s look at n=2.
This case is also pretty simple: there&amp;rsquo;s room for 2 dominoes side by side, and we could either place them both horizontally or both vertically.</description></item><item><title>Leapfrog - Solution</title><link>https://gofiguremath.org/brain-play/leapfrog-solution/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gofiguremath.org/brain-play/leapfrog-solution/</guid><description>→ Print-friendly version If you&amp;rsquo;ve played with this problem for a while, you might have noticed that getting to (1, 1) is quite troublesome. Every time the frogs seem to get close, they just miss the mark.
There&amp;rsquo;s a reason for that!
To see why this is so hard, let&amp;rsquo;s take a closer look at what a leap looks like.
To get from one frog&amp;rsquo;s location to another frog&amp;rsquo;s location, you can always take some number of steps to the right and some number of steps up.</description></item><item><title>Light Bulbs - Solution</title><link>https://gofiguremath.org/brain-play/light-bulbs-solution/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gofiguremath.org/brain-play/light-bulbs-solution/</guid><description>→ Print-friendly version Imagine that each light bulb is numbered: Bulb 1, Bulb 2, Bulb 3, etc. When Rachel pulls the chain of every nth bulb, only the bulb numbers divisible by n are affected. To see how the procedure affects an individual bulb, then, we just need to look at its divisors.
Take the case of Bulb 12. The divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12, as we can see when we multiply:</description></item><item><title>Moving Day - Solution</title><link>https://gofiguremath.org/brain-play/moving-day-solution/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gofiguremath.org/brain-play/moving-day-solution/</guid><description>→ Print-friendly version The first thing we notice is that the choices for the basketballs, volleyballs, baseballs, and golf balls are all independent: how Leslie assigns one type of ball to the different trucks doesn&amp;rsquo;t restrict how she might assign a different type of ball to the different trucks. So we can start with just the basketballs and hope that we can re-use our technique on the other kinds of balls.</description></item><item><title>Pennies - Solution</title><link>https://gofiguremath.org/brain-play/pennies-solution/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gofiguremath.org/brain-play/pennies-solution/</guid><description>→ Print-friendly version When we roll the outer penny around the central cluster, we&amp;rsquo;re rolling it from bump to bump 6 times. If we can figure out what happens just going from one bump to the next, we can just repeat that 6 times to get our overall result. Let&amp;rsquo;s zoom in on just the top part and see what it looks like geometrically.
Notice how we&amp;rsquo;ve connected the centers of the pennies together.</description></item><item><title>Pirate Gold - Solution</title><link>https://gofiguremath.org/brain-play/pirate-gold-solution/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gofiguremath.org/brain-play/pirate-gold-solution/</guid><description>→ Print-friendly version At every decision point, the five pirates are assessing what would happen if they accepted or rejected the proposal. If we start with the first decision, we&amp;rsquo;re going to need to handle some pretty complex decision criteria. So instead, we&amp;rsquo;ll start with a much simpler case: let&amp;rsquo;s imagine what would happen if most of the pirates were thrown overboard, and only 2 pirates &amp;ndash; Desdemona and Ed &amp;ndash; were left.</description></item><item><title>Salt and Pepper - Solution</title><link>https://gofiguremath.org/brain-play/salt-and-pepper-solution/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gofiguremath.org/brain-play/salt-and-pepper-solution/</guid><description>→ Print-friendly version We don&amp;rsquo;t know the size of the salt and pepper shakers. Is this a problem?
It turns out not to be, as long as we keep our eye on what happens with the teaspoon.
Step 1 in the procedure is to move a teaspoon of pepper to the salt shaker. This is pretty straightforward: one teaspoon of pepper is transferred.
Step 2 is to move a teaspoon of salt-and-pepper mix back to the pepper shaker.</description></item><item><title>Spider Socks - Solution</title><link>https://gofiguremath.org/brain-play/spider-socks-solution/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gofiguremath.org/brain-play/spider-socks-solution/</guid><description>→ Print-friendly version To find the probability that Harvey picks a valid order for his socks and boots, we want to count the number of valid orders for his socks and boots, and then divide that by the total number of ways Harvey might order his socks and boots.
Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the total number of orderings, since that&amp;rsquo;s the simpler part of this puzzle. Harvey has 16 pieces of footwear to choose from (8 socks plus 8 boots), so he has 16 choices for the first piece of footwear he puts on; after that, he has 15 choices for his second piece of footwear, and then 14 choices for his third, and so on, for a total of</description></item><item><title>Stargazing - Solution</title><link>https://gofiguremath.org/brain-play/stargazing-solution/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gofiguremath.org/brain-play/stargazing-solution/</guid><description>→ Print-friendly version At first glance, we might think of the star as consisting of many pieces that add together to form the overall shape. But there are a lot of pieces to handle if we think about it this way!
Let&amp;rsquo;s instead look at the area that&amp;rsquo;s not covered by the star:
That looks a lot simpler! Because of the star&amp;rsquo;s symmetry, all of the green triangles are congruent&amp;ndash; they have the same shape and the same size.</description></item><item><title>Swans - Solution</title><link>https://gofiguremath.org/brain-play/swans-solution/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gofiguremath.org/brain-play/swans-solution/</guid><description>→ Print-friendly version It&amp;rsquo;s simplest to think about the entire flock taking off by working one swan at a time.
After the first swan takes off, we&amp;rsquo;re at $k=1$. The probability that a second swan takes off is $1 - \frac{1}{1+3} = 1 - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4}$.
After the second swan takes off, we&amp;rsquo;re at $k=2$. The probability that a third swan takes off is $1 - \frac{1}{2+3} = 1 - \frac{1}{5} = \frac{4}{5}$.</description></item><item><title>The Magic Checkerboard - Solution</title><link>https://gofiguremath.org/brain-play/the-magic-checkerboard-solution/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gofiguremath.org/brain-play/the-magic-checkerboard-solution/</guid><description>→ Print-friendly version &amp;ldquo;Ohhh, I see,&amp;rdquo; Janelle said, after a long pause staring at the rectangle. &amp;ldquo;It doesn&amp;rsquo;t line up all the way!&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;What do you mean?&amp;rdquo; Terrence asked his big sister.
&amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s a really thin slit on the diagonal that&amp;rsquo;s not covered with paper,&amp;rdquo; Janelle explained, and she pulled apart the pieces of paper just slightly so the slit was more visible.
&amp;ldquo;Look at the slope of the diagonal cuts,&amp;rdquo; she continued.</description></item><item><title>Troll Trouble - Solution</title><link>https://gofiguremath.org/brain-play/troll-trouble-solution/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gofiguremath.org/brain-play/troll-trouble-solution/</guid><description>→ Print-friendly version Eventually you want to be in a position where there is only 1 pebble left and it&amp;rsquo;s the troll&amp;rsquo;s turn. That means if there are 2 pebbles left and it&amp;rsquo;s your turn, you should take away 1; and if there are 3 pebbles left, you should take 2. In those cases you can force the troll to take the last pebble.
On the other hand, you don&amp;rsquo;t want to have 4 pebbles left when it&amp;rsquo;s your turn, because after your turn there will be 2 or 3 pebbles left and the troll will be able to make you take the last pebble.</description></item><item><title>Wolf, Goat, Lettuce - Solution</title><link>https://gofiguremath.org/brain-play/wolf-goat-lettuce-solution/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gofiguremath.org/brain-play/wolf-goat-lettuce-solution/</guid><description>→ Print-friendly version Farmer Brown can&amp;rsquo;t take the wolf across first, since then the goat would be left behind with the lettuce, and we know what goats do to lettuce. Similarly, he can&amp;rsquo;t take the lettuce across first, since then the wolf would be left behind with the goat. But wolves don&amp;rsquo;t eat lettuce, so he takes the goat across first.
Next, he rows back alone, and then rows the wolf across.</description></item></channel></rss>
