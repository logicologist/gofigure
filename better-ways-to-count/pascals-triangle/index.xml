Remember choosing? Then you recall how to calculate
$$ \dbinom{6}{0}=1, \dbinom{6}{1}=6, \dbinom{6}{2}=15, \dbinom{6}{3}=20, \dbinom{6}{4}=15, \dbinom{6}{5}=6, \dbinom{6}{6}=1. $$
Look at those numbers you got, and look back at Pascal&amp;rsquo;s Triangle. Go ahead, scroll up and look.
Now why on earth&amp;hellip;?
If you think it&amp;rsquo;s a fluke, do some more calculations. I&amp;rsquo;ll wait.
Pretty, is it not?
In order to get to the root of this elegant mystery, let&amp;rsquo;s look at Pascal&amp;rsquo;s Triangle another way.</description></item><item><title>Some Neat Features</title><link>https://gofiguremath.org/better-ways-to-count/pascals-triangle/some-neat-features/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gofiguremath.org/better-ways-to-count/pascals-triangle/some-neat-features/</guid><description>→ Print-friendly version Pascal&amp;rsquo;s Triangle is riddled with intriguing patterns and embedded sequences. Here it is again:
For easy reference, we&amp;rsquo;ll call the lonely 1 at the top Row 0, and the row below that Row 1, then below that Row 2, and so on. Then in each row, the first 1 at the very left will be in Position 0, and the number to its right in Position 1, then to the right Position 2, etc.</description></item></channel></rss>
