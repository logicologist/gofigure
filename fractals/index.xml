Here&amp;rsquo;s how it works. We start with an equilateral triangle, which is one where all three sides are the same length:
Now we repeat the following rule on this triangle indefinitely:
The Rule: Whenever you see an equilateral triangle, like the one below on the left, chop it up into four little equilateral triangles, and get rid of the middle upside-down triangle, so you&amp;rsquo;re left with the thing on the right.</description></item></channel></rss>
