But let&amp;rsquo;s take another close look at our Fibonacci number friends.
In particular, let&amp;rsquo;s ask ourselves what happens if we divide each Fibonacci number by the one before it.
You recognize 1.618? (If not, go look back at our definition of the Golden Ratio!) It certainly looks like these Fibonacci ratios are converging on the Golden Ratio.</description></item><item><title>The Golden Angle</title><link>https://gofiguremath.org/natures-favorite-math/the-golden-ratio/the-golden-angle/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gofiguremath.org/natures-favorite-math/the-golden-ratio/the-golden-angle/</guid><description>→ Print-friendly version So far we&amp;rsquo;ve already talked about the Golden Ratio as a length. Now let&amp;rsquo;s talk about its close cousin the Golden Angle.
The Golden Angle happens when you break up a circle so that the ratio of the big arc to the little arc is the Golden Ratio. It&amp;rsquo;s like taking the line definition of the Golden Ratio and wrapping it into a circle &amp;ndash; green is to red as red is to blue.</description></item></channel></rss>
